# TODO

need a backend server and the servers correct API endpoint URL in the fetch method, in App.jsx (line 25).

I haven't tested the functionality since I need a server running, and I couldn't figure it out how to do, but everything else seems to be working.

cd to the gator-frontend

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

```

It should be running on localhost:5173.
